In addition, it seems to be that the \"after\" posts (and perhaps politics in general?) become more focused on people (Clinton, Sanders, Trump), which in itself isn't necessarily interesting (increased election-related news coverage; presumably it's on people's minds more regardless). However, it may be interesting if coupled with differences of variability in language. Lastly, I should rethink whether the timeframe for /r/politics is ideal, as it seems to be more in line with the \"after\" posts than the \"before\" posts."

Things aren\\'t all hunky-dory until all of a sudden, some village idiot from Texas jumps up and yells \"WAR!\" and shazam! All of a sudden you have a war on, you know.  No, there\\'s always a historical context to them. They\\'re a long time in developing.\\n\\nWhat you think of as a war that Bush started in 2003 by invading Iraq was actually started by his father, in 1991, when in the aftermath of Iraq\\'s invasion of Kuwait, the US govt decided that it wanted to remove Saddam and \"regime change\" Iraq. Clinton pursued this goal by maintaining a sanctions regime that starved 500,000 Iraqi children to death, trying to foment unrest/revolt, perhaps assassinate SH if possible, and occasionally dropping bombs on Iraq.\\n\\nTo say that Clinton didn\\'t have us in a war vs Iraq, while Bush got us into one, is like saying that an army that has surrounded a walled city, and is besieging it, trying to starve it into submission, isn\\'t at war with that city, while if it attempts to actually assault the walls, pound down its gates with battering rams, etc, it\\'s at war. That\\'s simply just absurd. Both situations are clearly wars. Just different tactics and methods are being used.\\n\\nThe other major foreign policy landmine that Bill Clinton left for us was his policy of aggressively pushing into Russia\\'s former sphere of interest, by expanding NATO.  Bush I had promised Gorbachev that if the USSR let East Germany go peacefully, the US/NATO would not seek to further encroach on the USSR\\'s buffer zone/sphere of interest.  Bill Clinton is the president who reneged on that, and step #1 in starting the process of dismantling Russia\\'s position in the Balkans &amp; Eastern Europe was the neutralization of Serbia.  That process has finally borne fruit under Obama, when we find ourselves in a proxy war against Russia (the world\\'s #2 nuclear armed power) in UKRAINE. Basically their back yard.  A foreign policy so insanely aggressive and neocon that it makes Bush\\'s invasion of Iraq look like a sober, careful, well-deliberated, and conservative move.\\n\\n&gt; raised taxes on the rich.\\n\\nWhat he really did was something like help them steal $1 trillion, then collect back $250bn of it.  Now all the naive people are going \"ooooh look, he got $250bn from rich people! What a man of the people, that Bill!\"\\n\\nClinton was basically a fascist.  The reason why more people don\\'t realize that can be laid at the feet of that incredible prevarication machine, the Dem party propaganda apparatus, and their useful idiots, liberal &amp; Dem partisan commentators.', 'A bad rule.\\n\\nThe essence of the justification is  \\n&gt; The most objective way for the moderation team to avoid inserting political bias into how submissions are handled is not to give exceptions and make judgement calls on whether slight changes are \"okay\" or not. We therefore enforce the title rules consistently even if that means removing articles for minor title changes.\\n\\nThat attempt at fairs is purchased at the cost of one of the reasons for reddit\\'s being: to allow end users to cut through some of the lazy practices of main stream news sources.\\n\\n']\n"

Going to need something more than your feels that this is a \"significant\" factor in driving up costs.  The removal of profit motives will undeniably lead to \"dramatic\" drops in quality of care.  You are honestly arguing that profit motives have, and will in the future, be a positive force in ensuring quality of care.  Are you even hearing yourself?  Profit motives by definition are singularly focused on maximizing profit, and we are simply awash in mountains of indications that no, in fact, profit motives alone have given rise to canceling of policies, declination of providing service for existing conditions due to insurer ROI, rising costs... do I really need to go on?  If you are actually going to continue to argue that profit motives are what will keep healthcare quality on the up and up then I really don\\'t know what else to tell you.  You are being willfully ignorant now.', 'This comment removal by moderators needs to stop.  Jeez.  The mods here are becoming as weak and victim prone as the pansies at r/the_donald.

Dannel Malloy and former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) as co-chairs of the platform and rules committees.\\n \\n&gt; “Gov. Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,” Brad Deutsch, legal counsel for the Sanders campaign, wrote in a letter to Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller, the co-chairs of the convention’s Rules and Bylaws Committee.\\n \\n&gt; “Their criticisms of Senator Sanders have gone beyond the dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the Senator and his Campaign,” he wrote. \\n \\n&gt; “The chairs therefore cannot be relied upon to perform their convention duties fairly and capably while laboring under such deeply held bias.”']\n"

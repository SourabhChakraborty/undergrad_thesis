      "['make up the difference between what you pay and what your workers need just to survive i am just going by my anecdotal evidence and some personal beliefs i don t think there should be a federal or state minimum wage businesses should set wages based on their expenses and what they can pay people for their time as well as will people work for at that rate if someone wants to pay someone 50 cents a hour in 2015 that is fine hopefully no one will take that job and then you have to base the salary job and level let s say that 50k a year is about 25 a hour there are several it jobs and professional jobs that are 50k a year in certain parts of the us let s say the minimum wage rate in seattle is 15 maybe it goes up to 20 a hour for slightly more skilled workers one of my first crappy jobs was at a movie theater i did absolutely nothing and was paid the min wage rate which was 5 at that time are movie theater workers in seattle getting paid 15 a hour jobs that go to high school and college kids that need a little spending money this is not what is needed to survive on survival when i was doing those low end min wage jobs most of the older guys in the same job 30 50 year olds were working multiple jobs now if they brought in about 20 a hour yea they worked about 70 hours a week total through overtime and did the same job somewhere around min wage wasn t really a survival wage for them they still pulled in 30 70k sometimes tax free working multiple jobs is this bad it was sometimes easy work that didn t require a lot of skill that is just what you did you set a federal min wage and now businesses won t allow overtime they can only allow for so many workers this is my point you haven t changed the economy for some businesses if you set a minimum wage rate of 15 they still made a thousand dollars a day now they have to cut their staff in half tl dr i feel businesses should run their businesses without worrying about regulatory set minimum wage rates for their employees wages should be based on what they can afford and what people will work for you can downvote me former governor jeb bush is running for president and is basically looking for no minimum wage if you get rid of min age it doesn t mean businesses stop paying people\\n', 'i have done so many jobs in my lifetime in different parts of the us if you have lived long enough in the us and you haven t committed a major felony you aren t surviving off a minimum wage job in the sense that by the time you reach 40 you have gained enough experience to move past the min wage job and if you are surviving off a min wage job because of your lack of skills or criminal history or drug addiction you take multiple jobs to survive and with automation and just the way modern work world works some min wage jobs aren t that bad if you can get them i mentioned movie theatre person i also worked moving books in a school warehouse not too bad paid 8 a hour to put books in boxes and there was overtime we can t pay everyone 20 a hour there are 300 million people in the us a lot of them are unskilled and have serious personal problems a lot of people have criminal records and drug problems and with those issues may not be able to contribute at the same level in a business so let s say we set the min wage to 20 so i can sit on my ass in a movie theater making 20 a hour but a trained paralegal makes 25 a hour it doesn t make any sense but that is where we are heading\\n', 'but there is still no law on who they can hire and how many people or how long they can allow them to work the nature and or economy of these businesses may not change so they may still see the same revenue but if you see a min wage increase for their employees they have to hire fewer workers or cut back on workers ultimately i bet you will see a shift from the small businesses to large business if you have two employees in seattle at a minimum for the 8 hours a day you have to make at least 12k a month to pay those two employees every business person i have known they monitor pennies if you raise the min wage from 7 a hour to 12 or 15 you are talking about 100 increase in one of your expenses it is insane for a small business i have seen guys try to cut costs of toilet paper and saved 50 a month a government enforced mandate is just nuts\\n', 'one might argue and most things don t operate in a vacuum maybe the governments influence of minimum wage is making it harder for more skilled workers to find jobs that pay more\\n', 'i am not making any assumptions why should the government come into your business and tell you how much you pay your employees i don t care to assume what an employee will do with their money but doesn t the government have to make many unscientific assumptions on what every american will do with the money they make you should be able to setup your business and pay your employees what you want in order to get the job done whether it is a cardiologist or a person that movies books from one room to another the government should get involved if there is fraud involved if the business doesn t pay what was agreed upon\\n', 'i make zero assumptions about the employees the employee is an expense to the employer i don t see how we can arbitrarily set a min wage rate when we haven t said anything about the business you said that employees should be paid because of their personal worries and what not but what about the business that has to pay the employee since there is no guarantee that the business can even exist or raise revenue to pay the employees why set the min limit on one aspect of their business and my only response take jobs that you can live off on and or gain skills where you can earn a certain wage\\n', 'i am just going of what jeb bush said\\n', 'i don t know the business could decide and the customer could chose to return or not return\\n', 'once again i argue so a federally regulated wage rate is the only way to address poverty you say if wal mart can set a wage rate at 12 a hour that helps poverty is it possible that a small business can hire two teenagers at 6 a hour to help jump start their business let s say you don t have a minimum wage rate it is possible that a small business can grow naturally without worrying about this regulation as it stands now people have accepted minimum wage so you can expect 20 30 100 increase on expenses from government regulations at any time how does a business respond to that\\n', 'and yes you can argue about bad decisions until you re blue but the reality is that if we do not support them then we perpetuate the cycle why would a business hire a person for a low skilled min wage job and they feel that they can t do the job and they may have personal issues that keep them from doing their job the job hasn t change and with automation and technology i don t have to hire that person that is supporting three kids if the wage rate increases

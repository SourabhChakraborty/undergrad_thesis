We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.\"', '&gt; fears that aren\\'t based in what history shows us\\n\\nHistory has shown us that when the cost of labor in the US rises, jobs go to places where it\\'s cheaper.  How many textile factories are there in the South these days?  It\\'s like you\\'re ignoring the literal millions of jobs that ARE ALREADY GONE to China/India/Mexico.\\n\\nLet me tell you my actual HISTORY to give a perspective of where I come from on this issue.  I grew up in a small town in \"flyover\" country.  There were 4 major employers in the town.  A university, a regional hospital, a toy factory, and a windows/doors factory.  My father worked at the university, my mother at the hospital.  \\n\\nAt the time of the following events, I was in elementary school.\\n\\nShortly after NAFTA passed, the window factory shuttered and moved to Mexico, taking 1200 jobs with it (out of a town of 15,000).  Less than two years later, the toy factory moved to China, taking 500 jobs.  One of the reasons cited for the move was that it was just \"cheaper\" to manufacture there.  That is, the cost of labor in my town was too high.  These weren\\'t \"unskilled\" laborers like at McDonald\\'s or Walmart.  These were fabricators, supply chain individuals, etc.  Those skills left the town as well.  But that wasn\\'t the end.\\n\\nThese jobs were lost, but it wasn\\'t just 1700 out of 15,000 that were affected.  Every one of those jobs included families and classmates.  My school went from 600 students to just over 200 over the next five years, meaning they had to lay off teachers.  The hospital lost local business so doctors were laid off and services had to be sourced from bigger hospitals elsewhere.  Restaurants and Suppliers that served the people of the town who had jobs previously began to tighten belts, or leave.  That is, the town was losing the people BEST equipped to make it a great place (doctors/businesspeople/healthcare providers/etc).\\n\\nThe town nearly died in the next ten years.  My family was very lucky to have parents who were working in healthcare and higher education.  My class size went from 25 kids to less than 10 in most classes.  My teachers had to combine grades (5-6 grades in one classroom, etc) since the local tax base fell and they couldn\\'t afford the debt payments on the school.\\n\\nToday, I live in a large city because, surprise, there aren\\'t any jobs in my hometown that are really feasible in my career choice (MBA/finance/analytics).  Even if I wanted to go back home where I grew up, I wouldn\\'t be able to due to lack of employment options even 20 years later.\\n\\nBecause labor became cheaper elsewhere (China/Mexico) the town nearly died.\\n\\nWhy does this matter?  Well, because Portland just made their local wages much more expensive for businesses to maintain. They just made it cheaper to take a business OUT of the city.  Sure, it won\\'t happen overnight, but slowly and surely, small local businesses will fail, people will move, and the town will never be the same.\\n\\nHaving lived the history and economics you\\'re ignoring, I come from an interesting perspective, I really wish people took it more seriously.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Spelling/wording/toopersonal', \"I was just pointing out that it was, in fact, mentioned.

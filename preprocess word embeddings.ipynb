Using the same crime, we see;\\n\\n* 78.4% non-hispanic\\n* 21.6% hispanic\\n\\nNow, what we do is subtract black/asian/indian/pacific islander from the non-hispanic portion.  Why?

Both parties just want to win.\\nAnd ultimately though Hillary may not have consistent values, she votes consistently. Nobody is realistically scared that Hillary will pull the rug out and become a super conservative president. She doesn\\'t change her mind at random, she changes it to follow the leftist trend. She\\'ll be a continuation of Obama.

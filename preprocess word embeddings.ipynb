      "[\"&gt; You have to admit, it's pretty artificial to include suicides because there's an excellent chance the suicide would have happened anyway, through some other means. I'd like to see the same figures with suicides removed.\\n\\nI always hear people assert this without evidence. Has anybody actually studied the incidence of non-gun suicide rates in tight vs. lax gun restriction states? I mean, if one side is going to the trouble to gather up evidence to support their point, it would seem that the other side would have an obligation to actually provide similarly relevant data before dismissing the conclusions.\", 'It may not be appropriate, or maybe it is, but if it\\'s legally protected then it\\'s legally protected. People started this discussion by stating that demonstrators went there to incite violence, and that they were trampling 1st Amendment rights. Instead, we know that violence occurred after the event was cancelled and these people were also exercising their 1st Amendment rights. Far different than what people implied, although MoveOn did have a part in organizing the protest, which is a concern of they encouraged violence. \\n\\nPeople protest people exercising their first amendment right all the time. A KKK parade (not calling anyone on either side here the KKK, just an example) was recently protested against in California. That\\'s all well and good. However, the end result was violence that came from both sides being heated, and someone was stabbed. That\\'s what\\'s wrong, but people protesting is as protected as people rallying. \\n\\nKeep in mind, what I think is dangerous and what I think both fueled people\\'s interest in protesting and fueled the violence that occurred, Trump is supporting violence against protestors. That\\'s what\\'s most dangerous in this situation. Again, a ~76 year-old punched a protestor who was being removed from an event and he later told reporters that next time, \"we may need to kill him.\"  I\\'m afraid that will actually happen because of the statements Trump is making and how those statements impact his very passionate followers. ', \"These aren't radical ideas, I disagree with them all and yet I don't think they're radical. \\n\\nAs much as I'm firmly against deportation and would rather a path to citizenship, what is radical is the sheer amount of taxpayer money wasted on people who don't belong in the country legally. It's actually insane. So I don't think it's very radical to propose that they be removed on the condition they may return as long as they do so legally.\\n\\n\\nAnd the wall is just all talk and even if it ain't who cares. Border protection isn't a horrible idea.

My apologies for misunderstanding.To the rest of it... The EPI post isn\\'t entirely accurate.  They attack Hubbard, who I hadn\\'t even heard of until I read the EPI\\'s argument awhile back.  To counter the points about wage stagnation and healthcare, we need to look at other sources.  1. [Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees, Total Private Sector](  - shows a constant increase, just not by that much.2. [Compensation of Employees, Received: Wage and Salary Disbursements](  - a much steeper ascent from 1990 compared to wages.  Wages \"doubled\" while compensation tripled.3. [Health plan deductibles are growing seven times as fast as wages](  - pointing out the cost of healthcare has outpaced earnings even since 2010, 2.5x for cost of insurance and nearly 7x from the perspective of deductibles.4. [Beyond the Wage Stagnation Story](  - discussing the [CBO\\'s reports](  on wage distribution, showing median wage from 1979 to 2007 increased 41% while most wages. Bottom 20% of income earners had a 18% increase, the next 60% had a 40% increase, the next 19% (ie, 20-2% earners or upper middle class) had a 65% increase, and the top 1% had a 275% increase.  5. [Decoupling of Wage Growth and Productivity Growth? Myth and Reality](  - showing how proper decoupling results in wage growth in line with productivity growth (see page 24\\'s chart), but compensation inequality (ie, healthcare, pensions, etc) is increasing, further evidence of my point 3 above.  The EPI uses two different deflators in their productivity/wage chart comparison, which is not the correct way to go about comparing things.  Furthermore, the EPI wrote [this piece](  back in July 2013 showing exactly what I said above- that productivity and wages have been linked for 99% of Americans, increasing together, while total wages+compensation (the second chart on the page) shows everything in line.  The EPI even cites [this 2007 study](  which supports my point even more (quote below from the paper the EPI cites)-The non-wage share of labor compensation rose from 12.6 percent in 1973 to 19.5 percent in 2006. The annual rate of real wage would have been 0.5 percentage points higher if the non-wage share of compensation had remained constant. The main factor behind the growth in the non-wage compensation was the rapid increase in the cost of employer provided health insurance. At this point... I don\\'t know what else to say about the wage stagnation issue :(Again what is good for industry is not necessary good for society as a whole.I maintain free trade is good.  I\\'m even writing a /r/badeconomics post to show it.  From the perspective of small-medium enterprises, SME\\'s exported $782 billion in 2013, imported $618 billion, and were responsible for 4.6% of the entire GDP.  Just SME\\'s, not major firms.  It\\'s also estimated that the $782 billion is responsible for supporting 4.38 million jobs, given the [USTR\\'s estimates 5,600 jobs for every $1 billion in exports](   And still, In fact, [women-owned exporting firms employ over five times more workers and pay an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women](   Minorities-owned exporting firms are similar, employing over three times more workers and paying on average $16,000 more compared to their non-exporting versions.  Most of the SME\\'s exporting after NAFTA were SME\\'s that never exported before, too.  That\\'s taking advantage of opportunity which benefits many folks!This is a really long post and I\\'m really, really sorry for that.  It\\'s important to understand context, especially with misleading articles like the EPI\\'s (contradicting their own statements from a couple years earlier).  I hope you can see some of the benefits from free trade and better understand some of the consequences of non-free trade a little more.

Whoever takes them to court can still lose...Seems pretty fair to me. In the cases that a gun manufacturer slips up and allows a gun to get into the hands of some crazy mother fucker who shouldn't have a gun, the manufacturer should be held accountable. If the crazy mother fucker stole the gun/bought it legally/ etc, no case would hold up in the court of law. Hillary Clinton is a trained lawyer who knows the law, much better than you or I. All she is saying is that gun manufacturers should not have some sort of special exemption on being taken to court, not that they should ALWAYS be sued whenever there is a mass shootingEasy to twist out of context or misunderstand, but it is actually a really straight forward policy that Bernie won't support because he is a senator from  rural Vermont\"]\n",
      "[\"regulation where not absolutely required does 'kink' market behavior.\\n\\nRegulation always has consequences on the market, it's just a question of how much you sacrifice for regulation.\", 'This is just the ABC News interview.\\n\\n[Tonight on NBC:]( \\n\\n CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: Do you accept everything that the State Department I.G. report said about your practices as fact?\\n \\n SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Chuck, the report makes clear that personal email use was the practice under other secretaries of state. And, the rules were not clarified until after I had left.\\n \\n But, I said this many times, it was still a mistake. If I could go back I would do it differently. And, I understand people have concerns about this, but I hope and expect voters to look at the full picture of everything I\\'ve done and stand for. And, the full threat posed by Donald Trump. If they do, I have faith in the American people that they will make the right choice.\\n \\n TODD: I got to ask you thought about a specific email that was unearthed in this I.G. report because it seems to contradict your reasoning for why you wanted a private email, and a private server. You were quoted in an email as saying this, \"I don\\'t want any risk of the personal being accessible,\" meaning when you were urged to get a state.gov email, you were open to it buy you were concerned. What were you concerned about? FOIA requests? Congressional requests? Can you explain what that sentence meant?\\n \\n CLINTON: Oh, of course not. I mean, this arose because I worried that some individuals that some individuals that I was emailing to on their state.gov accounts were not getting my emails, and I was concerned about how to fix that. I raised lots of different possibilities, but ultimately the technical problem was resolved, and I continued using my personal accounts for both work, and personal emails because I did think it was convenient, however I think it\\'s pretty clear looking back what I thought was convenient turned out to be anything but.\\n \\n And, as I have acknowledged, I should have just used two accounts. It was a mistake.\\n\\nSo, to be clear, Hillary doesn\\'t answer whether the IG report is factual, and repeats the \"other people did it\" and \"it was allowed\" disproven excuses.\\n\\nHowever, pressed on the \"I don\\'t want any risk of the personal being accessible\", she says\\n\\n CLINTON: Nobody wants their personal emails made public. That is a very common if not unanimous feeling among people. I was told this was a technical problem. It was resolved. I have... Like everybody else I know, I separate out my official email, I send it to .gov accounts, and as I have said many times since, you know, it was a mistake, I should have had two separate accounts so none of these questions would have been raised. The fact is, people have official accounts, they have personal accounts, and when it comes to personal, people don\\'t want their personal email accounts made public.\\n\\nThat is: She still doesn\\'t clarify what she means, but she admits that she was trying to hide the things in that account from being found. She somehow claims that she separated her work emails (false) and that she copied .gov on everything relevant (false; see: Blumenthal emails).\\n\\nShe basically could not answer what, specifically, she meant about not wanting the personal to be accessible. Not that she meant FOIA or Congress or something. And it\\'s not like she wasn\\'t presented with the idea of multiple accounts, as was detailed in the IG report yesterday.', ' We\\'re 50 years ahead of China in the environmental department and we have made huge strides in a few decades.\\n\\nEmissions in the US per person are about 2.5x higher than China - so you\\'re damaging the environment 2.5x as fast. \"Way ahead\"?

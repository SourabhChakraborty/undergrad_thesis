      "[\"&gt; You have to admit, it's pretty artificial to include suicides because there's an excellent chance the suicide would have happened anyway, through some other means. I'd like to see the same figures with suicides removed.\\n\\nI always hear people assert this without evidence. Has anybody actually studied the incidence of non-gun suicide rates in tight vs. lax gun restriction states? I mean, if one side is going to the trouble to gather up evidence to support their point, it would seem that the other side would have an obligation to actually provide similarly relevant data before dismissing the conclusions.\", 'It may not be appropriate, or maybe it is, but if it\\'s legally protected then it\\'s legally protected. People started this discussion by stating that demonstrators went there to incite violence, and that they were trampling 1st Amendment rights. Instead, we know that violence occurred after the event was cancelled and these people were also exercising their 1st Amendment rights. Far different than what people implied, although MoveOn did have a part in organizing the protest, which is a concern of they encouraged violence. \\n\\nPeople protest people exercising their first amendment right all the time. A KKK parade (not calling anyone on either side here the KKK, just an example) was recently protested against in California. That\\'s all well and good. However, the end result was violence that came from both sides being heated, and someone was stabbed. That\\'s what\\'s wrong, but people protesting is as protected as people rallying. \\n\\nKeep in mind, what I think is dangerous and what I think both fueled people\\'s interest in protesting and fueled the violence that occurred, Trump is supporting violence against protestors. That\\'s what\\'s most dangerous in this situation. Again, a ~76 year-old punched a protestor who was being removed from an event and he later told reporters that next time, \"we may need to kill him.\"  I\\'m afraid that will actually happen because of the statements Trump is making and how those statements impact his very passionate followers. ', \"These aren't radical ideas, I disagree with them all and yet I don't think they're radical. \\n\\nAs much as I'm firmly against deportation and would rather a path to citizenship, what is radical is the sheer amount of taxpayer money wasted on people who don't belong in the country legally. It's actually insane. So I don't think it's very radical to propose that they be removed on the condition they may return as long as they do so legally.\\n\\n\\nAnd the wall is just all talk and even if it ain't who cares. Border protection isn't a horrible idea. It's very easy to paint it as some xenophobic barrier between the supreme white nation of America and Mexico but that's simply not what it's about. \\n\\nAnd a temporary ban on incoming Muslims until we can determine how better to handle Muslim immigration also is a pretty sensible thing to do. \\n\\nI'm a bleeding heart progressive, but I'm also a rational and sensible person. The truth is that the MSM goes well out of its way to paint trump as some evil dictator and he isn't.

[Beyond the Wage Stagnation Story](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000331-Beyond-the-Wage-Stagnation-Story.pdf) - discussing the [CBO\\'s reports](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/10-25-HouseholdIncome_0.pdf) on wage distribution, showing median wage from 1979 to 2007 increased 41% while most wages. Bottom 20% of income earners had a 18% increase, the next 60% had a 40% increase, the next 19% (ie, 20-2% earners or upper middle class) had a 65% increase, and the top 1% had a 275% increase.  \\n\\n5. [Decoupling of Wage Growth and Productivity Growth? Myth and Reality](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1246.pdf) - showing how proper decoupling results in wage growth in line with productivity growth (see page 24\\'s chart), but compensation inequality (ie, healthcare, pensions, etc) is increasing, further evidence of my point 3 above.  The EPI uses two different deflators in their productivity/wage chart comparison, which is not the correct way to go about comparing things.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the EPI wrote [this piece](http://www.epi.org/blog/compensationproductivity-link-broken-vast/) back in July 2013 showing exactly what I said above- that productivity and wages have been linked for 99% of Americans, increasing together, while total wages+compensation (the second chart on the page) shows everything in line.  The EPI even cites [this 2007 study](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/growth_failure_2007_04.pdf) which supports my point even more (quote below from the paper the EPI cites)-\\n\\n&gt;The non-wage share of labor compensation rose from 12.6 percent in 1973 to 19.5 percent in 2006. The annual rate of real wage would have been 0.5 percentage points higher if the non-wage share of compensation had remained constant. The main factor behind the growth in the non-wage compensation was the rapid increase in the cost of employer provided health insurance. \\n\\nAt this point... I don\\'t know what else to say about the wage stagnation issue :(\\n\\n&gt;Again what is good for industry is not necessary good for society as a whole.\\n\\nI maintain free trade is good.  I\\'m even writing a /r/badeconomics post to show it.  From the perspective of small-medium enterprises, SME\\'s exported $782 billion in 2013, imported $618 billion, and were responsible for 4.6% of the entire GDP.  Just SME\\'s, not major firms.  It\\'s also estimated that the $782 billion is responsible for supporting 4.38 million jobs, given the [USTR\\'s estimates 5,600 jobs for every $1 billion in exports](http://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_002065.pdf).  And still, In fact, [women-owned exporting firms employ over five times more workers and pay an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women](http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf).  Minorities-owned exporting firms are similar, employing over three times more workers and paying on average $16,000 more compared to their non-exporting versions.  Most of the SME\\'s exporting after NAFTA were SME\\'s that never exported before, too.  That\\'s taking advantage of opportunity which benefits many folks!\\n\\nThis is a really long post and I\\'m really, really sorry for that.  It\\'s important to understand context, especially with misleading articles like the EPI\\'s (contradicting their own statements from a couple years earlier).  I hope you can see some of the benefits from free trade and better understand some of the consequences of non-free trade a little more.  We don\\'t need a \"Game of Thrones\"-style trade system where every country has tariffs/duties/barriers to every other countries.  Sanctions on orange juice means less OJ being produced (US demand will be fulfilled) which means less OJ revenue which means less OJ jobs.  That seems like a worse situation than more OJ jobs producing more OJ revenue for exports, don\\'t you think?', \"Alright, I looked at your profile.

So if the average attendee pays $60/game for food and souveniers, and another $100/game for the ticket, sales tax is another $6M/year.  Visiting team hotel fees and taxes, etc would add more.\\n\\nSo, the net of bond payments less taxes collected is maybe $10M/year now, declining as NBA salaries etc go up.

So many Americans use a far bigger car than they need. And the vast majority had a more efficient option available that they decided not to take. We don\\'t have those 15-25 years to wait - the 1.5C threshold will be locked in in 2020 or so, and the 2C budget is also fast approaching.\\n\\nIf Americans can\\'t do something as simple as pay a bit more for gas, forgo SUVs and get more efficient appliances, why would the Chinese stop increasing their energy consumption?\\n\\n They just don\\'t give a shit, similar to how we didn\\'t give a shit back in the day either.\\n\\nBullshit, they are well into nuclear and renewable research, are a huge producer of solar panels, and are implementing a carbon pricing scheme in 2017.
